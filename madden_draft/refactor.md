# Problems
- forms actions and forms are confusing
- module names maybe needs changes (bindings, form action)
- directories are not making to much sense.
- tabs are not centralized
  - app.ex
  - bindings.ex
  - constants.ex

- bindings are not well mapped, maybe the best option is to have more generic bindings
  - tabs changes generic (j,k)
- app model be dynamic
- Rethink about the OTP process, Board, Players needs improvements


## Tasks
- [] Re-organize modules and names
- [] Centralize pages, tabs names and form keys
