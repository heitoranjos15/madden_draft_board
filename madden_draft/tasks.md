# Madden Draft board
What need to do?
I need a application wich will save players from Madden Draft Board
Why?
To make both board Horizontal and Vertical works ok.
I'll List every player I've interest.
Then I'll rank they in my board so, in the day of draft I'll have my own board.


## Tasks
## Board Players
- [] Player details
  - [] show details based by player selected
  - [] Form
  - [] Save 
- [] Player list details
  - [] Show details player selected
  - [] Edit players details

- [-] List
  - [x] Navigation betwenn board and home
  - [x] Table players
  - [] Order by (rank, age, expected drafted)
  - [] Vertical board
## Error message
  Will be great to log message error on bottom bar instead of just throwing and ending the file
- [] Bot bar accepts error message
- [] Bot bar accepts log message (?)
- [] message when binding has error
- [] message when action save has error

We need to create a way to make this columns customized

$ MaddenDraft.Boundary.DraftSupervisor.create_board('2022')
$ MaddenDraft.Boundary.BoardManager.lazy_players('2022')
$ MaddenDraft.Boundary.BoardManager.show('2022')
```

Creating on view
```
$ iex -S mix

$ MaddenDraft.Boundary.BoardManager.show("Madden")
```

or get from pid
